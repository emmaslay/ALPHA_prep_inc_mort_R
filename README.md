# ALPHA_prep_inc_mort_R
R code to produce ALPHA's mortality and HIV incidence datasets
This repository contains the code needed to go from the ALPHA data specs to the two analysis-ready datasets used for estimating 1) mortality by HIV status and 2) HIV incidence.  The code requires the data to be in ALPHA spec format to run. </p>
ALPHA_data_sharing_master_from_specs_to_inc_and_mort.R, runs the files in the right order, once the directory structure is set up.
